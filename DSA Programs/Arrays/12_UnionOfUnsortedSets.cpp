/*
In case of sorted arrays we had easily find the union,
but for the unsorted array lets see :
Approach 1 : First approach will be that first copy all the element of the first array in the third array,
             After that perform the search operation i.e. check whether each element of second array is present or not in the third array,
             if element is present then simply continue and if not present then add it to the next index of third array,
             And repeat this process for each element of the second array.
             
             Time Complexity : O(n^2) Not good so we will be try to find more optimised solution
